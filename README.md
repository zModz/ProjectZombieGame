# üßü‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Project: ZombieGame
**Project: ZombieGame** is a round based game, takes place in a variety of maps based on space exploration, in the year 2051, the objective of the player is to survive the horde of enemies that go after him, the maps can be explored thought opening doors and this can help the player survive longer, but the difficulty will increase the more areas the player opens. The player will also have an armory of weapons to choose from, from handguns to assault rifles and even some special weapons the player can find around the map in weapon crates. You‚Äôre a group of soldiers that were sent to investigate a mysterious happening in the space station, an experimental virus spread out across the station and turned all scientists and employees into ‚Äúzombies‚Äù.
Enemies
Right now it‚Äôs still unclear what I want to do as enemies, right now the general idea is that they are zombies/infected.

_**Normal**_ ‚Äì Zombies that show up in every round, they are weaker but sometimes they run  
_**Tank**_ ‚Äì Zombie that shows up every 10 rounds, they take a while to kill and can damage you pretty bad but they are slow  
_**Bosses**_ - Massive creatures with a large healthbar to challenge the player

## Maps
**SpaceStation**   
*‚ÄúAfter the accident, the station turned into this dark and abandoned place with broken equipment and filled with blood.‚Äù*  
The playable area will divided in sections: Spawn, Labs, Rooms, Containment Room and the Main Lab, the Main Lab being the area where the accident happen, Containment Room is an area with containment chambers, and the Spawn is an area full of computers and equipment, the room before it being the landing area.  

**MoonStation**  
*‚ÄúA moon station used to control the activity from DS-1‚Äù*

**EarthHQ**  
*TBD*

**ControlCenter**  
*TBD*

## Gameplay
The movement system is smooth and responsive, something similar with recent shooters. It will also have a down system, meaning when your health is low, your character will fall to the ground for a couple seconds before coming back up, this will also only happen once.
While in-game, you‚Äôll be able to gain points by doing damage to enemies, with these points you‚Äôll be able to open doors to expand your play area and also buy weapons.
Buying weapons is an important system in the game and there are two ways to do this:  
* _**Wall-Buys**_ ‚Äì Across the map, there will be these screens on the wall displaying a picture of a weapon, those are Wall-Buys. After each purchase, you‚Äôll be able to buy ammo for that weapon but it will cost you more points.  
* _**Supply Crates**_ ‚Äì These are boxes in certain areas of the map that give you a random weapon for a certain amount of points, they also will be disabled for 10 seconds after each purchase.  
* _**Crafting**_ - The player can have the opportunity to craft weapons and/or equipemnt to help fight the undead, the parts required of crafting can be found around the map or after doing some small task.  

The soldiers equipment will be very modern, ballistic weapons and explosives, but since we‚Äôre in a space station best known for experiments, there could be some laser weapons and plasma explosives along the way. Ballistic Weapons will be able to be acquired through Wall-Buys, and Supply Crates. Laser weapons are only available in Supply Crates. The player would get perks by killing enemies, buying door and weapons, those actions would provide a different type of score to progress through.
To avoid players becoming super-soldiers, the perks could only be used for X amount of time. The score would cycle as much as the player can.
